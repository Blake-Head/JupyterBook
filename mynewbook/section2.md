# Dynamics

Now that we have learned a little about momentum and practiced how to solve problems with it, we can continue along our physics journey. 

In the previous section, we defined two quantities: momentum and impulse.  As equations, these are, respectively:


$$\vec{p} = m \vec{v}$$
$$\vec{J} = \Delta\vec{p} = \int_a^b \vec{F}(x) \ dx$$

You may remember from your calculus 1 course (or perhaps you're hearing it for the first time here) that integrating a function gives us the **area underneath that function** between our two limits *a* and *b*.
